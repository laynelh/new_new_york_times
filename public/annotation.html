            <div class="article-content" style="font: Georgia;">
                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p class="">Ai Weiwei is one of the most prominent figures within contemporary art, as well as
                        social
                        and political discourse regarding China, his home country. His works often critique these
                        systems, drawing from both Chinese culture and broader global trends. Ai has often played with
                        the idea of destruction of art, which raises the question: does this act of vandalism
                        unintentionally align with or subvert his previously established artistic motivations?
                    </p>
                    <p>The intentional destruction of this major artwork provokes a similar debate over the boundaries
                        of artistic expression and vandalism as Weiwei’s piece “Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn” did in the
                        past.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/drop.png" alt="3 photos of Ai dropping a Han dynasty Urn">
                    <p>This piece, created by Weiwei in 1995, consists of three consecutive black and white photographs
                        depicting the artist dropping and shattering a 2000-year-old urn from the Han dynasty in China.
                        One of the main themes within this piece is the idea of using destruction as a force of
                        creation. By destroying this important piece of Chinese art, he challenges the sacred nature of
                        tradition. Ai forces viewers to confront their emotional response to the destruction of cultural
                        objects and invites us to reevaluate how we assign value to material objects within our modern
                        culture. <a

                </div>
                <p class="normal-content">A reception for a new exhibition by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in Bologna,
                    Italy, was disrupted on
                    Friday when a man walked in and smashed a large, porcelain sculpture, leaving museum guests and the
                    artist stunned.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">The incident, which occurred during a reception for “Ai Weiwei. Who Am I?,”
                    the artist’s first solo
                    exhibition in the city, sent guests at the Palazzo Fava scattering and left the sculpture shattered
                    on the floor.</p>

                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p>The destruction of this art piece during Weiwei’s first solo exhibition can be seen in a
                        global context as a comment on China’s use of cultural heritage as a form of soft power. This
                        power refers to a nation’s ability to shape perspective and increase its influence through
                        cultural, artistic, and ideological means rather than through military or economic forces.
                        Weiwei’s work itself embodies this paradox - he challenges Chinese authoritarianism while
                        intentionally using materials and techniques that have historically contributed to the cultural
                        narrative the country wishes to protect. <a

                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="normal-content">Footage of the incident captured by security cameras and later shared on Mr.
                    Ai’s Instagram account
                    shows the man forcefully pushing over the sculpture and then raising its broken pieces above his
                    head before being tackled by museum guards.</p>

                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p>It is interesting to think about why Weiwei decided to share this incident on his Instagram
                        account. Sharing this information parallels Weiwei’s negative views on censorship, seen in his
                        long-standing critiques of the Chinese regime and state censorship. By posting these videos, he
                        allows us as viewers to see the full life of the piece and makes a conscious effort to avoid
                        exerting control over the narrative. He releases his power over the piece and opts for
                        transparency, an approach that underscores his commitment to openness and makes space for a
                        broader conversation about the value and impermanence of art. <a

                </div>

                <p class="normal-content">Mr. Ai said in an emailed statement on Monday that the loud sounds of the
                    sculpture shattering made
                    him first think of a terrorist attack or an explosion.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">“When I learned that it was my large porcelain artwork that had been
                    destroyed, I was astonished,” he
                    said. “I never imagined that a piece nearly 100 kilos in weight could be damaged so easily.”</p>

                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p>It is important to note porcelain’s role in Chinese culture and art, particularly as a luxury
                        item. Although the sculpture itself weighed 100 kilos in total, the porcelain material is very
                        fragile and deepens the significance of Weiwei’s ability to manipulate that material into a
                        large, cube-like shape.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="normal-content">Arturo Galansino, the exhibition's curator at the Palazzo Fava, said by phone
                    on Monday that he was
                    upstairs at the event when he heard a “big noise” and was quickly alerted that a work had been
                    broken.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">The piece, titled “Porcelain Cube” and weighing more than 200 pounds, was
                    displayed on the ground
                    floor of the museum, he said. He was unsure of the sculpture’s monetary value.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">“I was very, very disappointed and sad and shocked,” Mr. Galansino said,
                    adding that he believed the
                    destruction of the sculpture was intentional. The episode somewhat ruined the atmosphere of the
                    evening, he added.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">Left behind were dozens of broken blue and white porcelain pieces, which were
                    eventually neatly
                    arranged on a pedestal and later covered with a sheet.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">Mr. Ai noted that acts of vandalism in museums were not uncommon, regardless
                    of the reason behind
                    them, but he said he was grateful that no one, including the man behind Friday’s incident, was
                    physically harmed.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">In the aftermath, the artist shared a short video of the man being arrested.
                    Local news outlets
                    identified him as Vaclav Pisvejc, a Czech-born aspiring artist who has developed a reputation for
                    similar stunts.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">“Unfortunately, the person who did this accident, it's not the first time that
                    he commit this crime,”
                    Mr. Galansino said. He said he was unsure how the man was able to access the event, which was
                    invite-only.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">“He's a person that likes to gain attention disturbing exhibitions and being
                    in contact with
                    worldwide artists,” Mr. Galansino said.</p>

                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p> The author of this article includes this heavily biased quote from the art curator to
                        highlight his opinion, however, this could also be misconstrued as the article’s thoughts. This
                        contains some demagogic logical thinking, making vague and unchecked statements about his
                        motivations and personality to try and sway other’s opinion of the person in question.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="normal-content">In 2018, Mr. Pisvejc attacked the artist Marina Abramovic in Florence by
                    slamming a paper portrait he
                    had made over her head. After that incident, Ms. Abramovic asked him why he had acted out. He
                    responded, “I had to do it for my art.”</p>

                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p> Pisvejc's previously established pattern of destruction and art vandalism has cemented his
                        reputation as a troubled artist and earned him extensive jail time and heavy fines. He justifies
                        his attacks as “performance” and a means-to-an-end to his goal of shaking and reshaping the
                        foundation of the art world. Abramovic, an established performance artist most known for her
                        works “The Artist is Present” and “Rhythm O”, maintained a stoic and calm demeanor during this
                        attack. She acted as the foil for Pisvejc's desire for chaos and received much more positive
                        feedback as a result. In this way, Pisvejc failed in his mission to engage viewers by instead
                        painting himself as a villain in the art world. <a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/arts/design/marina-abramovic-attacked-florence.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimesarts">New

                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="normal-content">Other past incidents involving Mr. Pisvejc have featured nudity and
                    denunciation. He has also been
                    accused of vandalizing with spray paint a statue by the Swiss artist Urs Fischer in the central
                    Piazza della Signoria.</p>

                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p> Performance art is a form of contemporary art that is often traced back to the 1910’s and the
                        avant-garde artists of the time. The art form primarily uses physical movement, actions, and
                        even the artist's own body as part of the piece. <a href="https://imma.ie/what-is-art/series-1-1970-now/performance-art/">IMMA</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="normal-content">And last year, he was arrested after he climbed a statue in Florence while
                    naked with the word
                    “censored” written on his body.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">Back at the museum, the exhibition officially opened on Saturday and will go
                    on as planned. The
                    porcelain cube, however, will not be replaced.</p>

                <p class="normal-content">“The process of an artwork's destruction and its true meaning happen
                    simultaneously, and even if a
                    replacement is made, it cannot restore the existential value of the original,” Mr. Ai said in his
                    statement. “I believe it should remain as it is now, a blank space where it once stood, with a
                    photograph of the piece prior to its destruction serving as an explanation.”</p>

                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p> Weiwei's acceptance of this destruction subtly reinforces his authority in the art world,
                        implying that even when others disrupt his art, the intrinsic value and the original artist’s
                        control over the piece cannot be fully destroyed. By leaving the destroyed sculpture as a black
                        space, Ai acknowledges and incorporates the vandalism into the life of the artwork itself,
                        transforming it into a moment of reflection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach also opens up a larger conversation related to how we as viewers perceive and
                        assign value to cultural artifacts, and even to art as a whole. Weiwei legerages his global
                        influence and artistic platform to challenge narratives about China and provoke discussions
                        about free speech and cultural identity (creating his own soft power). By doing so, he reclaims
                        elements of his Chinese culture, which the state uses to assert its own soft power, and
                        recontextualizes them within his message of resistance. The act of vandalism against the
                        “Porcelain Cube” connects directly to his use of soft power. By not replacing the sculpture, he
                        turned the atack into a shared moment of reflection, using the shattered pieces and the blank
                        space as a metaphor for loss, reinterpretation, and the power of discourse over physical form.
                        This harnesses the act of description as a means to further exercise soft power and fuel the
                        larger cultural dialogue it inspires.

                    <p>In our ever-expanding and globalizing world, soft power continues to increase its influence over
                        our views across multiple aspects of society. Recent events, including the destruction of Ai
                        Weiwei's work, reflect the larger phenomenon surrounding the fragility of cultural symbols and
                        their use as tools of influence. My motivation for bringing in these experts is to understand
                        both what soft power is and its role in shaping dialogues around identity, politics, and
                        tradition. Additionally, I hope to explore how the context of violence within this art
                        challenges or redefines our perception of cultural value and resistance. Going forward we should
                        seek to understand the implications of destruction not only within the art world, but also in
                        how it affects the power dynamics between artist, audience, and state.
