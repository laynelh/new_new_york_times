            <div class="article-content" style="font: Georgia;">
                <p>A reception for a new exhibition by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in Bologna, Italy, was disrupted on
                    Friday when a man walked in and smashed a large, porcelain sculpture, leaving museum guests and the
                    artist stunned.</p>

                <p>The incident, which occurred during a reception for “Ai Weiwei. Who Am I?,” the artist’s first solo
                    exhibition in the city, sent guests at the Palazzo Fava scattering and left the sculpture shattered
                    on the floor.</p>
                    
                <div class="annotated-text">
                    <p>This is the annotated text that needs to stand out, with a border for potential annotations or
                        notes.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Footage of the incident captured by security cameras and later shared on Mr. Ai’s Instagram account
                    shows the man forcefully pushing over the sculpture and then raising its broken pieces above his
                    head before being tackled by museum guards.</p>

                <p>Mr. Ai said in an emailed statement on Monday that the loud sounds of the sculpture shattering made
                    him first think of a terrorist attack or an explosion.</p>

                <p>“When I learned that it was my large porcelain artwork that had been destroyed, I was astonished,” he
                    said. “I never imagined that a piece nearly 100 kilos in weight could be damaged so easily.”</p>

                <p>Arturo Galansino, the exhibition's curator at the Palazzo Fava, said by phone on Monday that he was
                    upstairs at the event when he heard a “big noise” and was quickly alerted that a work had been
                    broken.</p>

                <p>The piece, titled “Porcelain Cube” and weighing more than 200 pounds, was displayed on the ground
                    floor of the museum, he said. He was unsure of the sculpture’s monetary value.</p>

                <p>“I was very, very disappointed and sad and shocked,” Mr. Galansino said, adding that he believed the
                    destruction of the sculpture was intentional. The episode somewhat ruined the atmosphere of the
                    evening, he added.</p>

                <p>Left behind were dozens of broken blue and white porcelain pieces, which were eventually neatly
                    arranged on a pedestal and later covered with a sheet.</p>

                <p>Mr. Ai noted that acts of vandalism in museums were not uncommon, regardless of the reason behind
                    them, but he said he was grateful that no one, including the man behind Friday’s incident, was
                    physically harmed.</p>

                <p>In the aftermath, the artist shared a short video of the man being arrested. Local news outlets
                    identified him as Vaclav Pisvejc, a Czech-born aspiring artist who has developed a reputation for
                    similar stunts.</p>

                <p>“Unfortunately, the person who did this accident, it's not the first time that he commit this crime,”
                    Mr. Galansino said. He said he was unsure how the man was able to access the event, which was
                    invite-only.</p>

                <p>“He's a person that likes to gain attention disturbing exhibitions and being in contact with
                    worldwide artists,” Mr. Galansino said.</p>

                <p>In 2018, Mr. Pisvejc attacked the artist Marina Abramovic in Florence by slamming a paper portrait he
                    had made over her head. After that incident, Ms. Abramovic asked him why he had acted out. He
                    responded, “I had to do it for my art.”</p>

                <p>Other past incidents involving Mr. Pisvejc have featured nudity and denunciation. He has also been
                    accused of vandalizing with spray paint a statue by the Swiss artist Urs Fischer in the central
                    Piazza della Signoria.</p>

                <p>And last year, he was arrested after he climbed a statue in Florence while naked with the word
                    “censored” written on his body.</p>

                <p>Back at the museum, the exhibition officially opened on Saturday and will go on as planned. The
                    porcelain cube, however, will not be replaced.</p>

                <p>“The process of an artwork’s destruction and its true meaning happen simultaneously, and even if a
                    replacement is made, it cannot restore the existential value of the original,” Mr. Ai said in his
                    statement. “I believe it should remain as it is now, a blank space where it once stood, with a
                    photograph of the piece prior to its destruction serving as an explanation.”</p>
