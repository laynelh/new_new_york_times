            <div class="article-content" style="font: Georgia;">
                <p>Natural Diamonds are classified as carbon that has been compressed below the Earth’s mantle for
                    millions of years. The last known natural diamonds were mined by a marine mining vessel off the
                    coast of Namibia on Sunday, September 15, 2176. This event, though inevitable, came as a somber
                    reminder after countless warnings from climate conservation scientists who cautioned that the days
                    of mining these rare gems were numbered.
                </p>

                <p>For centuries, natural diamonds dazzled and mesmerized the masses. Their iconic sparkle graces the
                    jewelry and crowns of the elite while bringing love to millions through the popularization of
                    engagement rings. The stone can be seen making an appearance at almost every exclusive and important
                    event throughout history, appearing in Europe as early as 1074 when they adorned a Hungarian queen’s
                    crown. Over time, they became synonymous with luxury, wealth, and exclusivity, thrusting the mineral
                    into the spotlight of society's rich and powerful. Some notable diamonds of the past include the
                    Hope Diamond, known for its rumored curse, The Cullian diamond located at the helm of the
                    Sovereign's Scepter with Cross, and the Koh-i-Noor, said to be a gift from the gods. Transcending
                    the physical, diamonds ingrained themselves into pop culture through many different types of media
                    including medieval paintings, song, and video content. One instance of this includes the song
                    “Diamonds are a girl's best friend” sung by Marylin Monroee in 1954.

                <p>Natural diamonds hold a much longer history than humans, with most forming at least <a
                        href="https://www.gemsociety.org/article/gem-formation/#Diamond_Gem_Formation">1 billion years
                        ago amongst temperatures up to 1300 degrees Celsius</a>
                    within the Earth's mantle. In some instances,
                    diamonds can form up to 150 miles into the mantle. It is widely known as the hardest mineral on
                    Earth, <a
                        href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/discussion/opinion-harder-than-diamond-have-scientists-really-found-something-tougher-than-natures-invincible#:~:text=Mild%20steel%20has%20a%20Vickers,of%20around%2070%20%E2%80%93%20100%20GPa.">even
                        surpassing steel</a>. Most diamonds made their way to the surface through volcanic activity,
                    leaving the mineral scattered throughout ancient lava tubes.</p>


                <p>Diamonds were <a href="https://www.naturaldiamonds.com/real/the-diamond-story/">first discovered by
                        humans in India nearly 4,000 years ago</a>. During this time, they were
                    prized for their medicinal properties and did not appear in Europe until 327 BC. Throughout history,
                    radiance and strength warped into an underlying perception of luxury and invincibility. Royals in
                    Europe believed diamonds made them invincible, associating the gem's indestructibility with their
                    own rule. For millennia, diamonds have been endowed with myths and folklore, imbuing them with
                    cultural and symbolic power. </p>

                <p> Historically, the diamond trade has contributed significantly to our economies, becoming a pivotal
                    source of revenue for previously war-torn countries with greater access to this resource. Despite
                    these economic contributions, diamond mining is known to have significant environmental impacts
                    including habitat destruction, water pollution, and carbon emissions. Furthermore, the mining
                    industry is a notoriously bad working environment, with some workers getting paid merely 1 dollar a
                    day. In 2001, it was reported that the <a
                        href="https://diamondfacts.org/economic-growth/#:~:text=Diamonds%20represent%20approximately%2021%25%20of,it%20started%20operating%20in%201994.">Diamond
                        and Jewelry business generated an annual 24.1 billion
                        in economic value</a>. As these natural diamonds became less common, this estimate increased to
                    a
                    staggering <a href="just_kidding.html">120 billion in global exports in the year 2095</a>. Natural
                    diamonds, once abundant enough to
                    be traded freely, were elevated to near-mythical status as their availability waned. We as a species
                    have internalized this scarcity as value, leading to this ballooning of price, an increase in
                    underground trading activity, and a rise in overall criminal activity associated with the stone.
                </p>

                <p>A likely motivator for such growth is the carefully crafted relationship between diamonds and love.
                    The first documented proposal using a diamond engagement ring was in 1477 when <a
                        href="https://www.leibish.com/the-history-of-diamond-jewelry-article-1433?srsltid=AfmBOoq8KVfMPfz0OtV_6VByfuznyIkYQRhehWdG3n1SRuZPR6XW3NbT">Archduke
                        Maximilian
                        of Austria asked Mary of Burgundy to be his wife</a>. Thus, a new precedent was set and began to
                    spread
                    throughout the upper classes of Europe. This tie to love and romance developed further during the
                    mid 20th century when the company De Beers released the slogan “A Diamond is forever,” This slogan,
                    along with other clever marketing tactics, transformed the stone into a staple of the loving
                    relationship and greatly contributed to their rise in popularity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tangentially, the contention between lab and natural diamonds maintained a steady pace, beginning
                    with <a href="https://www.vrai.com/journal/post/the-history-of-lab-grown-diamonds">the first lab
                        created diamonds in 1954 by General Energy</a>. During these early years, lab
                    diamonds were considered imitations of their natural counterparts. However, the creation of the
                    first gem-quality lab diamond in 1971 marked a turning point in history and opened the public to lab
                    diamonds as a true substitute for natural diamonds. In recent years, <a
                        href="just_kidding.html">technological advances have
                        made it easier than ever to create such gems </a>, increasing their distribution. This has
                    unintentionally caused their monetary value to plummet, contrasting the seemingly infinite increase
                    natural diamonds are enjoying since this announcement. Beyond their increasing affordability, lab
                    diamonds have a significantly lower carbon footprint and little to no ecological impact. As natural
                    diamond supply comes to a stop, we can expect a corresponding decrease in energy consumption
                    associated with diamond production, further minimizing the environmental impact.

                <p>A gem of the Earth, born in fire and miraculously traveling towards the surface, only to be exploited
                    to the point of extinction by humans. Just as we as a species have consumed without regard for our
                    environment, we depleted and destroyed something we held with such value. Looking toward the future,
                    we can only hope to protect our environment from further destruction, though the loss of the natural
                    diamonds may only be the beginning.
