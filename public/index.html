            <div class="article-content" style="font: Georgia;">
                <p>Natural Diamonds are classified as carbon that has been compressed below the Earth’s mantle for
                    millions of years. The last known natural diamonds were mined by a marine mining vessel off the
                    coast of Namibia on Sunday, September 15, 2176. This event, though inevitable, came as a somber
                    reminder after countless warnings from climate conservation scientists who cautioned that the days
                    of mining these rare gems were numbered.
                </p>

                <p>For centuries, natural diamonds dazzled and mesmerized the masses. Their iconic sparkle graces the
                    jewelry and crowns of the elite while bringing love to millions through the popularization of
                    engagement rings. The stone can be seen making an appearance at almost every exclusive and important
                    event throughout history, appearing in Europe as early as 1074 when they adorned a Hungarian queen’s
                    crown. Over time, they became synonymous with luxury, wealth, and exclusivity, thrusting the mineral
                    into the spotlight of society's rich and powerful. Some notable diamonds of the past include the
                    Hope Diamond, known for its rumored curse, The Cullian diamond located at the helm of the
                    Sovereign's Scepter with Cross, and the Koh-i-Noor, said to be a gift from the gods. Transcending
                    the physical, diamonds ingrained themselves into pop culture through many different types of media
                    including medieval paintings, song, and video content. One instance of this includes the song
                    “Diamonds are a girl's best friend” sung by Marylin Monroee in 1954.

                <p>Natural diamonds hold a much longer history than humans, with most forming at least 1 billion years
                    ago amongst temperatures up to 1300 degrees Celsius within the Earth’s mantle. In some instances,
                    diamonds can form up to 150 miles into the mantle. It is widely known as the hardest mineral on
                    Earth, even surpassing steel. Most diamonds made their way to the surface through volcanic activity,
                    leaving the mineral scattered throughout ancient lava tubes.
                </p>

                <p>Diamonds were first discovered by humans in India nearly 4,000 years ago. During this time, they were
                    prized for their medicinal properties and did not appear in Europe until 327 BC.Yet diamonds were
                    never merely ornamental. Throughout history, radiance and strength warped into an underlying
                    perception of luxury and invincibility. Royals in Europe believed diamonds made them invincible,
                    associating the gem’s indestructibility with their own rule. For millennia, diamonds have been
                    endowed with myths and folklore, imbuing them with cultural and symbolic power.
                </p>
                <p>Historically, the diamond trade has contributed significantly to our economies, becoming a pivotal
                    source of revenue for previously war-torn countries with greater access to this resource. In 2001,
                    it was reported that the Diamond and Jewelry business generated an annual 24.1 billion in economic
                    value. As these natural diamonds became less common, this estimate increased to a staggering <a
                        href="just_kidding.html">120 billion</a> in global exports in the year 2095. Natural diamonds,
                    once abundant enough to be traded freely, were elevated to near-mythical status as their
                    availability waned. We as a species have internalized this scarcity and internalized it as value,
                    leading to this ballooning of price, an increase in underground trading activity, and a rise in
                    overall criminal activity associated with the stone.
                </p>

                <p>A likely motivator for such growth is the carefully crafted relationship between diamonds and love.
                    The first documented proposal using a diamond engagement ring was in 1477 when Archduke Maximilian
                    of Austria asked Mary of Burgundy to be his wife. Thus, a new precedent was set and began to spread
                    throughout the upper classes of Europe. This tie to love and romance developed further during the
                    mid 20th century when the company De Beers released the slogan “A Diamond is forever”. This slogan,
                    along with other clever marketing tactics, transformed the stone into a staple of the loving
                    relationship and greatly contributed to their rise in popularity.
                </p>

                <p>Tangentially, the contention between lab and natural diamonds maintained a steady pace, beginning
                    with the first lab created diamonds in 1954 by General Energy. During these early years, lab
                    diamonds were considered imitations of their natural counterparts. However, the creation of the
                    first gem-quality lab diamond in 1971 marked a turning point in history and opened up the public to
                    lab diamonds as a true substitute for natural diamonds.In recent years, <a
                        href="just_kidding.html">technological advances </a>have
                    made it easier than ever to create such gems, increasing their distribution. This has
                    unintentionally caused their monetary value to plummet, contrasting the seemingly infinite increase
                    natural diamonds are enjoying since this announcement.
                </p>

                <p>A gem of the Earth, born in fire and miraculously traveling towards the surface, only to be exploited
                    to the point of extinction by humans. Just as we as a species have consumed without regard for our
                    environment, we depleted and destroyed something we held with such value. Looking toward the future,
                    we can only hope to protect our environment from further destruction, though the loss of the natural
                    diamonds may only be the beginning.
